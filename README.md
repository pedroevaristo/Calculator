## What is My Best Friend Calculator
It is a project that promotes a tool that facilitates the progress of studies for university students who do not want to spend money on expensive calculators, especially in Brazil. My motivation is to make a complete one that has Basic, Scientific and Financial functions. In addition, I intend to offer it to Desktop and Mobile users for free, with the help of the community, increasing it to the best ones.

Observation: I don't how it'll be of control of commits, however I going to try talk with community of reddit or discord to help me and learn how to manager these new codes.

In this moment I'm focusing to evolve the code and my concepts of programming. Applying:

- Software Architecture
- S.O.L.I.D.
- Testes
- Design Pattern
-## Roadmap

- [X] Basic Calculator
    - [X] Applying basic Operations;
    - [X] To have a interface to receive input from user (CLI)
    - [X] To have historic Math Operations

- [ ] Calculator Scientific
    - [ ] Add scientific operations (e.g., power, square root, logarithms, trigonometric functions)
    - [ ] Switch interface between Basic and Scientific
    - [ ] To have an interface using JavaFX
    - [ ] To have a graphic of calculations (e.g., plot functions)
    - [ ] Persistent Data:
        - [ ] Capability to save historic information in a file
        - [ ] Implement an option to load the saved file in the software
        - [ ] Use formats like JSON, CSV, or plain text
    - [ ] Support math expressions:
        - [ ] Capable to evaluate complex expressions (e.g., `(2 + 3) * 4`)
        - [ ] Implement Shunting Yard algorithm for parsing expressions
        - [ ] Add support for parentheses and operator precedence

- [ ] Calculator Financial
    - [ ] Implement basic financial calculations (e.g., simple interest, compound interest, future value)
    - [ ] Add advanced financial calculations (e.g., NPV, IRR, loan amortization)
    - [ ] Use a financial library like Finance4J for complex calculations
    - [ ] Add support for currency conversion using an API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API)
    - [ ] Implement investment analysis features (e.g., ROI, risk analysis)
    - [ ] Add financial planning tools (e.g., retirement planning, budgeting)
    - [ ] Create a separate GUI tab for financial operations
    - [ ] Validate user inputs to avoid invalid values
    - [ ] Use graphs to display financial projections (e.g., JFreeChart for desktop, MPAndroidChart for Android)

- [ ] Unit Testing
    - [ ] Write tests for basic operations
    - [ ] Write tests for scientific functions
    - [ ] Write tests for financial calculations
    - [ ] Write tests for GUI components
    - [ ] Write tests for data persistence (e.g., file saving and loading)

- [ ] Documentation
    - [ ] Write a user manual for the calculator
    - [ ] Document the code using Javadoc
    - [ ] Create a developer guide explaining the architecture and design patterns used
    - [ ] Add comments to explain complex logic

- [ ] Deployment
    - [ ] Package the application for desktop (e.g., JAR file)
    - [ ] Package the application for Android (e.g., APK file)
    - [ ] Create an installer for desktop platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
    - [ ] Publish the Android app on Google Play Store
    - [ ] Set up continuous integration (CI) for automated testing and deployment
